Goal:
Recreate a view identical to the Genesys Cloud Billing page, with the following tabs and data presentation:
Tabs:
Users, Apps, Devices, Resources (excludes Cloud Voice charges), Messaging, Storage
Data Source
Use the JSON data provided (site_response.txt).
The main objects are:
"currency": e.g., "USD"
"enabledProducts": list of enabled products (for reference)
"usages": array of all usage and billing entries
"minimumMonthlyAmount" and "subscriptionType" for subscription details.
Logic for Each Tab
1. Users Tab
Filter all usages with:
"grouping": "user-license" OR "billable-app-usage-license" OR "billable-app-concurrent-license" 
Display:
name
partNumber
usageQuantity
unitOfMeasureType
overagePrice
Calculate Total Amount = usageQuantity * overagePrice
Sum all totals to show “Total User Charges”
2. Apps Tab
Filter all usages with:
"grouping": "billable-app-org-license" 
Display:
name, usageQuantity, overagePrice
Compute total = usageQuantity * overagePrice
Show total Apps cost.
3. Devices Tab
Filter where:
"grouping": "device" 
Display:
name, usageQuantity, overagePrice, unitOfMeasureType
Total = usageQuantity * overagePrice
4. Resources (Excludes Cloud Voice Charges) Tab
Filter:
"grouping": "resource" 
Exclude where:
"name" includes "Genesys Cloud Voice" 
Show:
name, partNumber, usageQuantity, overagePrice
Total = usageQuantity * overagePrice
5. Messaging Tab
Include:
"grouping": "messaging" OR "messaging-usage" 
Display:
name, unitOfMeasureType (e.g., message, number, conversation)
usageQuantity, overagePrice
Total = usageQuantity * overagePrice
6. Storage Tab
Include:
"grouping": "storage" OR "storage-category" 
Show:
name, usageQuantity (GB), overagePrice
Total = usageQuantity * overagePrice
Additional Guidelines
Currency: Use "currency" value from the JSON (USD).
For any tab, include a summary card showing:
Total items displayed
Total cost (sum of calculated totals)
Handle missing or zero usageQuantity gracefully (show 0).
Exclude isThirdParty = true from calculations.
For accurate billing:
Display totalBillingAmount at the top of the billing view.
UI Recommendation
Match Genesys Cloud Billing Page layout:
Tab navigation at the top
Each tab with a sortable table
Totals in footer or summary card
Optional currency symbol next to each price (e.g., $12.50)
Example table columns:
Name | Unit Type | Quantity | Price (USD) | Total
totalBillingAmount = sum(all tab totals)
